Export images into their own folder with no other files in the datasets folder and enter folder name.
If name is left empty will default to FoodTest1.

images that do not match the formatting of the initial dataset will likely break the program, 
we can likely change this for running the model on the test set as breaking the name of the file down into id's will be irrelevant
